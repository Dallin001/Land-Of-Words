    <p>The Letter A lived in the Land of Words.
<br>
        She was very picky about everything.
<br>
        She was very fancy and had to make sure that everything she had was the best.
<br>      
        When she bought shoes, she tried on every pair in the store.
<br>        
        When she went for ice cream, it took her three hours to pick a flavor.
<br>
        And when she did, she spit it out for being too cold.</p>
        <br>

<br>
<p>She had her house painted 12 different colors before finally picking “rainbow”.
<br>
    It seemed like nothing was quite good enough for the Letter A.</p>
    <br>

<br>
    <p>One day she decided to have a dinner party.
        <br>
        She would invite all her friends and show them a wonderful and fancy evening.
        <br>
    She sent out the invitations on the fanciest paper that she could find.</p>

    <br>
    <p>When the other letters started to arrive, they noticed some problems.
        <br>
    “I need a chair with two cushions,” said the Letter W.
    <br>
    “I like my food cold,” said the Letter Z.
    <br>
    “I want to eat outside,” said the Letter B.
    <br>
    The Letter A ran around trying to fix all the problems.
    <br>
    She brought an extra pillow for the Letter W’s chair.
    <br>
    She stuck the Letter Z’s food in the freezer for a minute.
    <br>
    She moved the entire table outside for Letter B.</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>“I want to hear music,” said the Letter M.
        <br>
        “I need three plates,” said the Letter I.
        <br>
        “I want my dessert now,” said the Letter Q.
        <br>
        The Letter A couldn’t believe how picky everyone was being.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5493706de4b0ecaa4047b871/1635400420569-KLWXFZAUX461DQN8XW48/Letter-A-5+copy.jpg?format=1500w" alt="Annoyed">
        <br><p>She played some music on her flute for the Letter M.
            <br>
            She found three extra plates in her cupboard and made extra food for the Letter I.
            <br>
            She made the dessert and brought it out before she even had time to eat her own food (it didn’t matter because the Letter I had eaten it anyway).</p>
            <br>
            <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5493706de4b0ecaa4047b871/1635400471358-S3HK1AZOY3UEYE10U2VV/Letter-A-6+copy.jpg?format=1500w" alt="Music">
            <p>She was very tired and hungry from all her work.
                <br>
                All she had left to eat was a small piece of bread. 
                <br>
                Every bite of it was delicious, and for the first time, Letter A wasn’t picky at all.</p>

                <p>In the Land of Words, the happiest letters are those who are happy with what they have.</p>
